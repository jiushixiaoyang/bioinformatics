##use the install packages function to install the package "devtools" which we will use in a moment. dependencies = TRUE tells R to install any other packages that devtools relies on which you haven't already installed (I would always suggest keeping dependencies = TRUE when you are installing packages)
install.packages("devtools", dependencies = TRUE)
##load the devtools package
library("devtools")

##install the "vroom" package
##The arguement for install_github takes the username and repository name where the package resides 
##if we look at the vroom url: https://github.com/r-lib/vroom
##you can see that we just use the bit after github.com/:
install_github("r-lib/vroom")

## tell R to use the "vroom()" function from the vroom package (see below)
vroom::vroom()

##make sure vroom is loaded into your R session (you only need to do this once)
library(vroom)
##read in the wader data set
wad_dat <- vroom("C:/Users/qj21146/Downloads/wader_data.csv")

##look at the top of the data
head(wad_dat)

##first we set the working directory (which is the location of the current file you are working on):
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))

##then read in the data using vroom:
wad_dat <- vroom('./Bioinformatics_data-master/Workshop 3')
