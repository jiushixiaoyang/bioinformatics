##use the install packages function to install the package "devtools" which we will use in a moment. dependencies = TRUE tells R to install any other packages that devtools relies on which you haven't already installed (I would always suggest keeping dependencies = TRUE when you are installing packages)
install.packages("devtools", dependencies = TRUE)
##load the devtools package
library("devtools")

##install the "vroom" package
##The arguement for install_github takes the username and repository name where the package resides 
##if we look at the vroom url: https://github.com/r-lib/vroom
##you can see that we just use the bit after github.com/:
install_github("r-lib/vroom")

## tell R to use the "vroom()" function from the vroom package (see below)
vroom::vroom()

##make sure vroom is loaded into your R session (you only need to do this once)
library(vroom)
##read in the wader data set
wad_dat <- vroom("C:/Users/qj21146/Downloads/wader_data.csv")

##look at the top of the data
head(wad_dat)

##first we set the working directory (which is the location of the current file you are working on):
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))

##then read in the data using vroom:
my_data <- vroom('../Workshop 3/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv')

##use vroom to read in some data from github:
covid_dat <- vroom("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiushixiaoyang/bioinformatics/main/Code/Workshop%203/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv")

##you can ignore this code for the moment if you want
##but to briefly summarise it is reading in some data included in base R
##and then splitting it into 3 differnt data.frame style objects based on the values in one of the columns ("cyl")
mt <- tibble::rownames_to_column(mtcars, "model")
purrr::iwalk(
  split(mt, mt$cyl),
  ##save this split files in to the default directory
  ~ vroom_write(.x, glue::glue("mtcars_{.y}.csv"), "\t")
)
##find files in the default directory which start with "mtcars" and end in "csv"
##save these file names as an object called "files"
files <- fs::dir_ls(glob = "mtcars*csv")
##these are then the names of the files matching the above arguments:
files
##then load these file names using vroom 
vroom(files)

##load in some RData(a file type)
load("my_data/pathway/my_data.RData")

vroom::vroom_write()
library(vroom_write)
##write out a .csv file
vroom_write(my_data,"C:/Users/qj21146/Desktop/the_name_of_my_data.csv")
?vroom_write()
###### why can't find function vroom_write?????
### finally it works!!!

##write out my data as an RData file:
save(my_data, file = "C:/Users/qj21146/Desktop/the_name_of_my_RData.RData")
######not work#####work now!!!
##write out my data as an RData file:
save(my_data, 
     my_vector, 
     my_list, 
     my_array,
     file = "a pathway/a data folder/the_name_of_my_RData.RData")


##install the tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")
##load the tidyverse

##### can't see what guidance said in Global Environment


##what class is the object
class(covid_dat)
##look at the data
covid_dat
####### the data is different from that in the guidance!!!

##change the first two names of our data frame
names(covid_dat)[1:2] <- c("Province.State", "Country.Region")
covid_dat


##so this says take our data frame called covid_dat
covid_long <- covid_dat %>%
  ##and then apply this function 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c( Province.State, 
                          Country.Region, 
                          Lat, 
                          Long))
covid_long

##our data frame
covid_long <- covid_dat %>%
  ##and then apply this function 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(Province.State:Long),
               names_to = "Date",
               values_to = "Deaths")
covid_long

##change long to wide
covid_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Date,
              values_from = Deaths)
covid_lon#### why it's wide, I think it's still long???????
